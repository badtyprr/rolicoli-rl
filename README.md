## 🏗️ Architecture

### System Overview

The project consists of several key components:

1. **Game Engine** (requires `pokemon_tcg_rl.py` - not included)
   - Complete Pokemon TCG rules implementation
   - Card database and deck building
   - Game state management

2. **Gym Environments**
   - `pokemon_tcg_gym_env.py`: Battle environment wrapper
   - `pokemon_tcg_draft_env.py`: Draft environment wrapper
   - Full OpenAI Gym API compliance

3. **Training Infrastructure** (`train_sb3.py`)
   - RecurrentPPO with LSTM policies
   - Vectorized environments for parallel training
   - Automatic checkpointing and evaluation
   - TensorBoard logging

4. **Utilities**
   - `install_sb3.py`: Cross-platform installation with GPU detection
   - `benchmark_sb3.py`: Performance benchmarking tools
   - `test_installation_sb3.py`: Installation verification

### State Representation

The environment provides a 32-dimensional observation vector:

```python
# Player features (16 dims)
- Active Pokemon: HP ratio, stage, energy, attacks, status
- Bench: Size and total HP
- Resources: Hand size, deck size, prizes

# Opponent features (10 dims)
- Active Pokemon: HP ratio, stage, energy
- Bench: Size
- Resources: Hand size, deck size, prizes

# Game state (6 dims)
- Turn count, phase, energy/supporter played
- Current player, stadium in play
```

### Action Space

200 discrete actions covering all possible game actions:
- Playing Pokemon (Basic, Evolution)
- Attaching Energy
- Playing Trainer cards
- Retreating
- Attacking
- Ending turn

## ⚡ Performance

| CPU (4 envs) | 500 | ~33 minutes |
| GPU (4 envs) | 2000 | ~8 minutes |
| GPU (8 envs) | 3500 | ~5 minutes |

### Model Performance

| Opponent | Win Rate | Avg Game Length |
|----------|----------|-----------------|
| Random | 85% | 15 turns |
